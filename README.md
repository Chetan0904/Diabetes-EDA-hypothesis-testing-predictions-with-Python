# Project title:
Diabetes-EDA-hypothesis-testing-predictions-with-Python
# Project Overview:
This project focuses on the analysis of diabetes medical data and building predictive models to predict diabetes status. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, observations, and the development of various models to predict the presence or absence of diabetes.
# Steps involved:
1. Importing important Libraries and loading Dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis by checking duplicates, shape, null values and visualization to check age, gender and bmi distribution on the basis of diabetic and non diabetic peoples also checking other factors like bloodpressure, physical activity etc for diabetic and non diabetic patient.
3. Hypothesis testing to check difference between bmi, physical health, bloodpressure etc for diabetic and non diabetic patient.
4. Building models to predict diabetes status based on different variables.
